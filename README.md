## Getting Started

In this section you will find the basic folder structure and everything you need to get the theme up and running the first time to start developing.

### Folder Structure

| Name                  | Description |
| -------------:        |---------------
| `angular-cli.json`    | Used for configuration of project specific settings. You can add external styles and scripts, change the output folder, add assets, add environment files and more. | 
| `e2e`                 | Will be used for end-to-end tests to ensure functionality for users before deploying.      |
| `node_modules`        | All external modules used are here. Do not mess with this folder, as it is auto-generated by using `npm install`.      |
| `package.json`        | Contains all dependencies used for production and development. |
| `src`                 | Contains all Angular 2 Typescript code, assets and basically everything the end user will have access to. |
| `tslint.json`         | Angular-CLI includes an automatic Typescript-Linter, which can be configured with this file. |

### Using Angular-CLI

Angular-CLI allows you to create a new App in a matter of seconds and provides an awesome way to generate scaffolds for basically all Angular2-Components. [You can take a look at what commands are available here.](//github.com/angular/angular-cli#generating-components-directives-pipes-and-services)

In this article, we are going to install Angular-CLI and it's prerequisites and then generate our first project with a few various components.

---

###Prerequisites
Before we can install Angular-CLI we will have to get a few thing set up first. To run Angular-CLI we will need to install these 2 prerequisites first.

* **NodeJS** v4 or newer  
and
* **Typings** v1 or newer

[A detailed instruction on how to install NodeJS is available here.](//docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

After installing NodeJS there is just one thing left to do: Simply install **Typings** globally by running the command `npm install -g typings` and wait for *npm* to do the dirty work.

If you are on a *UNIX environment, you might have to run the command as administrator. This is done by simply prepending sudo: `sudo npm install -g typings`

---

###Installing Angular-CLI
Installing Angular-CLI is as simple as running this simple command:

`npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`  
or
`sudo npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`

and the package manager `npm` will do the rest.

---

###Generating the first `Component`
Now that we have installed all prerequisites it's time to start developing our app. Angular-CLI offers a lot of assistance and allows you to generate basically all Angular2-Components there are. *(In a smart way!)*

To generate our first `component` we simply open up a terminal and navigate in our Angular2-App. Now we simply run `ng g component client` and we get a new component in `/src/app/client` with the following files:

* `client.component.ts`
* `client.component.html`
* `client.component.css`
* `client.component.spec.ts`

The files `client.component.ts` and `client.component.spec.ts` contain the most code, the other files only contain placeholders.

**client.component.ts**

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  moduleId: module.id,
  selector: 'app-client',
  templateUrl: 'client.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['client.component.css']
})
export class ClientComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

}
```
By executing this short command, we just saved ourselves a lot of time creating all these `Component` files and boilerplate code.

[Syntax for all commands are available here.](//github.com/angular/angular-cli#generating-components-directives-pipes-and-services)

---

###Generating a Service in a specific folder
Now we have our `component`, but what if we want to share some data between components and need to create a `service` to manage this all. Well, we probably would want the service to be in the correct folder, either right in the components folder or in the `shared` folder in `/src/app/`.

Either way, with Angular-CLI we can generate in any folder, wherever we want. Simply use the path *(relative to `/src/app/`)* and use it as the name of the generated component.

`ng g service shared/client`  
or
`ng g service client/shared/client`

Or anything you need.
Afterward we will find two generated files in our specified folder: `client.service.ts` and `client.service.spec.ts`.

**client.service.ts**
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class ClientService {

  constructor() { }

}
```
###Live-Preview and App-Start

Now that we have generated our components, we sure want to see how the result will look like. Luckily Angular-CLI comes pre-configured with a **Live Compile and Reload Server** for which you simply have to run `ng serve` and after a few seconds your site will be live at `http://localhost:4200`.

![demo image](images/demo.png)

All changes you now make to your app will automatically be compiled and your open browser window will be reloaded.

These were the first steps with the awesome Angular-CLI and Angular2. Following we are going to get more in detail about developing with Angular-CLI and using the power of Angular2 right.

## Customizing

Everything shown in the demo can also be customized and most things are generated dynamically, for example the navigation menu.

### Add a Menu Item

Menu Items can be added in runtime by importing the `SidenavService` and adding menu items there. Here's an example:
```typescript
export class TestComponent {
  constructor(
    private sidenavService: SidenavService
  ) {
    let components = sidenavService.addItem('Components', 'layers', '/components', 2);
                     sidenavService.addSubItem(components, 'Buttons', '/components/buttons', 1);
   }
}
```

The function `addItem` accepts 4 parameters:
```typescript
sidenavService.addItem('The name shown in the navigation menu',
                       'the material icon to be used', 
                       'the route to put in [routerLink]',
                       'position in menu as number');
```

To create a dropdown menu with sub-items you can use the `addSubItem` function. The parameters are similar:
```typescript
sidenavService.addSubItem(referenceToParentItem (as shown in the example above),
                       'The name shown in the navigation menu',
                       'the material icon to be used', 
                       'the route to put in [routerLink]',
                       'position in sub-menu as number');
```

### Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are generated automatically from the current route, but you can also add custom user-friendly names. Adding "friendly names" for routes is done like this:
```typescript
export class TestComponent {
  constructor(
    private breadcrumbService: BreadcrumbService
  ) {
    breadcrumbService.addFriendlyNameForRoute('/components', "Components");
    breadcrumbService.addFriendlyNameForRoute('/components/buttons', "Buttons");
   }
}
```

The first parameter is the route to name, the second is the new breadcrumb name for this route.

### Receive, send and map data to a server with GET and POST requests

Receiving data from a server to process or display it in Angular 2 can be quite tricky with the new observables and syntax. Here you'll find an example how you can do this.

First of all create an abstract `BaseService` where you configure your Backend-URL and the correct paths for your backend.

**base.service.ts**
```typescript
import { Http, Headers } from '@angular/http';
import { Inject, Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';

@Injectable()
export abstract class BaseService {
  config: String;
  http:   Http;
  modelName: string;
  model: any;

  constructor(@Inject(Http) http: Http) {
    this.http   = http;
    this.config = 'http://yourBackend.url'
  }

  mapListToModelList (list: Array<Object>) {
    list.forEach((item, index) => {
      list[index] = this.mapModel(item);
    });

    return list;
  }

  mapModel(model: any) {
    return this.model(model);
  }

  findById(id: number, populate: Array<string> = null) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let url = this.config + '/' + this.modelName + '/' + id;

      if (populate) {
        url = url + '?populate=' + populate.join(', ');
      }

      console.log('URL', url);

      this.http.get(url)
        .map(res => res.json())
        .subscribe(res => {
          if (res.error) {
            reject(res.error);
          } else {
            resolve(this.mapModel(res));
          }
        });
    });
  }

  find(populate: Array<string> = null) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let url = this.config + '/' + this.modelName;

      if (populate) {
        url = url + '?populate=' + populate.join(', ');
      }

      this.http.get(url)
        .map(res => res.json())
        .subscribe(res => {
          if (res.error) {
            reject(res.error);
          } else {
            resolve(this.mapListToModelList(res));
          }
        });
    });
  }

  upsert(model: any) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let url = this.config + '/api/' + this.modelName;

      var headers = new Headers();
      headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');
      headers.append('Accept', 'application/json');

      this.http.put(url, JSON.stringify(model), {headers : headers})
        .map(res => res.json())
        .subscribe(res => {
          console.log(res);
          if (res.error) {
            reject(res.error);
          } else {
            resolve(this.mapModel(res));
          }
        });
    });
  }

  create(model: any) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let url = this.config + '/' + this.modelName;

      var headers = new Headers();
      headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');
      headers.append('Accept', 'application/json');

      this.http.post(url, JSON.stringify(model), {headers : headers})
        .map(res => res.json())
        .subscribe(res => {
          console.log(res);
          if (res.error) {
            reject(res.error);
          } else {
            resolve(this.mapModel(res));
          }
        });
    });
  }
}
```

Then you'll need a more specific service, in this example it's called `CustomerService`. This Service `extends` the `BaseService` inheriting all it's functions.
 
You will need to define a variable `modelName` which will appear in the called GET path in `BaseService`.

**customer.service.ts**
```typescript
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { Http } from "@angular/http";
import { BaseService } from "../../shared/base.service";
import { Customer } from "./customer.model";

@Injectable()
export class CustomerService extends BaseService {
  model: any;
  modelName = 'customer';

  constructor(@Inject(Http) http:Http) {
    super(http);

    this.model = (construct: any) => {
      return new Customer(construct);
    };
  }
}
```

Before using the data, you should map it as a class, so Typescript knows what it is and you know later on too.
This is a sample `Customer` class.

**customer.model.ts**
```typescript
export class Customer {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;

  constructor(model: any = null) {
    if (model) {
      this.firstName = model.firstName;
      this.lastName = model.lastName;
    }
  }
}
```

Last but not least you can finally inject the `CustomerService` and call one of these functions:
- `.find()` => GET to http://yourBackend.url/customer -> returns Array of Customers
- `.findById(1)` => GET to http://yourBackend.url/customer/1 -> returns single Customer Object
- `.create(model)` => POST to http://yourBackend.url/customer
- `.upsert(model)` => UPDATE to http://yourBackend.url/customer

**customer.component.ts**
```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { CustomerService } from "../shared/customer.service";
import { Customer } from "../shared/customer.model";

@Component({
  selector: 'app-customer',
  templateUrl: './customer.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./customer.component.css']
})
export class CustomerComponent implements OnInit {
  customers: Customer[] = [ ];

  constructor(private customerService: CustomerService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.customerService.find().then((customers) => {
      this.customers = customers;
    });
  }
}
```

Note: You may need to adjust the `import` paths according to your directory structure.

### URL mapping on an Apache Server

To allow for the URL to automatically route to the appropriate component on an Apache server like the internal `ng serve` server, you need to create a .htaccess file that routes all requests to the `index.html` file.

Here is an example how we did it on our demo-page:
```.htaccess
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

Note: We're using https, if you don't have or need https, remove the `s` from `https://` and the `RewriteCond` with `%{HTTPS} off`.
